    <p>
      This is a pizza that Australians expect to see on every pizza menu, no
      matter how traditional Italian or how big-chain the pizzeria in question
      is. Ironically though, as soon as I wrote that sentence, I popped onto the
      Pizza Hut website only to find that gasp, shock, horror Capricciosa is not
      on offer on their menu. Dominos Pizza, however, does have it. Phew. Order
      has been restored in the world! (Though it’s only a recent menu addition,
      I believe.) I was interested to learn that Pizza Capricciosa is apparently
      an Australian thing. That’s not to say it doesn’t exist in Italy. It does,
      it’s just not as common as, say, Margherita. And there’s no strict rules
      for what goes on it. In fact, “capricciosa” means “random” in Italian so
      perhaps a pizzeria invented this using whatever they had on hand! However,
      the combination of artichokes, mushrooms, olives and ham is the most
      common version that Australians have come to expect on Pizza Capricciosa.
      And that’s what I put on mine!

      <li>
        ▢ 1/2 cup artichokes from a jar, preferably oil, drained & sliced (Note
        3)
      </li>

      <li>
        ▢ 2/3 cup (70 g) shaved leg ham , torn into pieces (thinner is better)
        (Note 4)
      </li>
      <li>▢ 1/4 cup sliced kalamata olives (or black olives)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instruction</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 250°C / 480°F (both fan and standard). Allow time to get
        it nice and hot!!
      </li>
      <li>Pizza sauce – Mix the ingredients in a small bowl then set aside.</li>
      <li>
        Pizza base – Make and stretch out your chosen pizza base (no rolling
        pin!), stretch onto a pizza pan or baking tray per the directions in
        your chosen pizza base. (Note 4 for pizza stone)
      </li>
      <li>
        Top – Spread the pizza sauce on the pizza, leaving a 1 cm/1/2" border
        along the edge. Sprinkle with cheese first, then drape the ham randomly
        across the surface, sprinkle with olives, artichoke slices and
        mushrooms. (If using the no-yeast pizza base, spray/brush exposed crust
        with olive oil.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 10 – 12 minutes, turning after 4 minutes, or until the the
        cheese has golden spots and the crust is crispy. Cut and eat, stat!
      </li>
    </ol>
