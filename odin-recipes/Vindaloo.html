      Vindaloo Beef Curry Vindaloo is a traditional tomato-based curry gifted to
      the world from Goa, a sunny pocket of paradise on the Western coast of
      India. The origins of Vindaloo can be traced back to the time when
      Portugal ruled Goa in the sixteenth century. In fact, the name Vindaloo
      comes from carne de vinha dâ€™alhos, a Portuguese dish of pork, wine, and
      garlic. Local chefs added a stack of spices, switched the wine for
      vinegar, and thatâ€™s how Vindaloo as we know it today came about (in a
      nutshell!) A staple of Indian restaurant menus around the world, this
      curry is one for spicy food lovers!! ðŸŒ¶ Vindaloo is loved for its fiery
      heat and intense sauce, which packs a generous combination of spices and
      is sharpened with a good whack of vinegar. It can be made with most
      proteins, including lamb, goat, pork, prawns, chicken and you could even
      do a vegetarian number. While pork is actually traditional, here in
      Australia beef is the most popular version in Indian restaurants so thatâ€™s
      what Iâ€™m sharing today. Chunks of meat are slow-cooked for two hours in
      the Vindaloo sauce until itâ€™s so tender it easily yields to the touch of a
      spoon!

      <li>Salt beef: Toss beef in salt.</li>
      <li>
        Check spiciness of kashmiri chilli powder and adjust if desired. See
        Spiciness Note below.
      </li>
      <li>
        Curry Paste: Place Curry Paste ingredients in a Nutribullet or small
        food processor with 1 cup of the water. Blitz until smooth. Pour over
        beef. Pour remaining 1 cup water into Nutribullet, shake (to clean out
        remaining curry paste), then pour/scrape over beef.
      </li>
      <li>
        Marinate beef: Mix beef in curry paste, cover, then marinate 2 hours.
        (Note: marinade is fairly thin â€“ the water cooks down during slow
        cooking.)
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 190Â°C/375Â°F (170Â°C fan).</li>
      <li>
        Curry sauce: Melt ghee over medium high. Cook onion, ginger and garlic
        until they become translucent â€“ about 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mustard seeds: Add black mustard seeds then cook until onion is tinged
        with gold. Stir in tomato paste, cook 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Puree sauce: Add beef stock, stir. Transfer into a jug then use a stick
        blender to puree until smooth. Pour back into the pot.
      </li>
      <li>Add beef: Add beef and curry leaves, stir then bring to boil.</li>
      <li>
        Slow cook: Cover with a lid, then place in the oven for 2 hours or until
        beef is fall apart tender and the sauce has darkened in colour and
        thickened. (See Note 7 if sauce hasn't reduced enough).
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve: Garnish with coriander, then serve over basmati rice with a side
        of naan!
